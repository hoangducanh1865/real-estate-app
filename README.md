## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

*   **Node.js:** (Which includes npm) You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). LTS version is recommended.
*   **Git:** For cloning the repository.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone this project:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    ```
    *(Replace `<your-repository-url>` with the actual URL of the repository)*

2.  **Navigate to Project Directory**
    Change your current directory to the newly cloned project folder:
    ```bash
    cd <project-directory-path>
    ```
    *(Replace `<project-directory-path>` with the path of the folder created by the clone command)*

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    Run the following command to install all the necessary Node.js packages listed in `package.json`:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    *(You can also use the shorthand `npm i`)*

4.  **Run the Development Server**
    Execute the following command to start the local development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

5.  **View the Website**
    Once the server starts (you'll usually see a message in the terminal indicating it's running), open your web browser and navigate to the local address provided. This is often:
    `http://localhost:3000` or `http://localhost:5173` (or similar - check the terminal output).
